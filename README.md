# Kiosk app

This project builds a basic chashbox system for small kiosk's, stall's and sales. You are invited to improve the system and contribute to the project. Just ask if there are questions.

## install

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/DoctorFuchs/kiosk
```

Then make sure python 3 is installed. If not please install (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

#### optional!
install module mysql -> When you want to use mysql (change it in config) else this step is optional

```
pip3 install mysql
```

Then download the community edition of mysql. And start mysql.
Now you need to change config data. (much fun, because the config is so beautiful :D) 
(/backend/config.py)

```
cd <kiosk_folder>
