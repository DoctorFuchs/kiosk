# Kiosk app

This project is a basic chashbox system for small kiosk’s, stall’s and sales. The backend is build in python, the frontend with the three web design technologies HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You are invited to improve the system and contribute to the project. Just ask if there are questions.

## install

Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/DoctorFuchs/kiosk
```

Then make sure python 3 is installed. If not please install (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

#### optional!
install module MySQL for python (only if you want to use MySQL, else this step is not required):

```shell
pip3 install mysql
```

Then download the community edition of MySQL and start MySQL.
Now you need to change the config file. (much fun, because the config is so beautiful :D) 
(/backend/config.py)

## run

Once installed and MySQL server running (if you're using MySQL) it's very simple to use this app.

```shell
cd <kiosk_folder>
python3 run.py
```

at windows:
```shell
cd <kiosk_folder>
python run.py
```
